## **[Still under construction]**

Additional material for the TMA Submission *Propagating Threat Scores With a TLS Ecosystem Graph Model Derived by Active Measurements*, providing access to published data and tools.


To supplement our paper, we provide the following additional contributions:

- A graph parsing pipeline that can be used to construct an ITEG
- Example ITEG created from the Tranco top list as input and two blocklists
- The message-passing based PTP implementation used in the paper, and the computed scores on the example ITEgraph
- The Figures from the paper as interactive plots.
