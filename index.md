## **[Still under construction]**

Additional material for the TMA Submission *Propagating Threat Scores With a TLS Ecosystem Graph Model Derived by Active Measurements*, providing access to published data and tools.


To supplement our paper, we provide the following additional contributions:

- A [graph parsing pipeline]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/pipeline.md %}) that can be used to construct an ITEG
- Example ITEG created from the Tranco top list and two blocklists
- The [message-passing based PTP implementation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ptp.md %}) used in the paper, and the computed scores on the example ITEG
- The [Figures]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/figures.md %}) from the paper as interactive plots.
